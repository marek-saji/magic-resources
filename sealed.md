# How does sealed work?

## What will you need?

- 6 unopened draft boosters
- Selection of basic lands
- Preferably: card sleeves
- Preferably: a box for the deck you will create (40+ cards)
- Box for the rest of the cards (~66) or all if you don't have a deck box (~106)
- [Magic Companion](https://magic.wizards.com/en/products/companion-app) app installed

## How do we do it?

- Everyone opens 6 boosters together.
- We let ourselves around ¬Ω hour to create decks out of these cards. You can add as many basic lands as you need ‚Äî the rest must come from the boosters.
- We use [Magic Companion](https://magic.wizards.com/en/products/companion-app) to create the event and decide who plays with who.
- Winner of the event gets to keep ‚Äúbox topper‚Äù ‚Äî a bonus card that's included in a booster box (at least for most sets).
- We take any other cards (overflow boosters, cards that came free with the order etc.) and distribute them amongst players. Starting with last player they can keep one card and pass to the next player in the ranking. Last player choosing (event winner) chooses two cards and we continue in reverse order.

## Tips for building a deck

- We are required to build decks that have at least 40 cards. You are allowed to go over as much as you want, but it's best to keep it up 40.
- There's a [recommended card distribution](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13lglvTH3dDVUz4k9G1NLzoiRJzrCaWacC0iLHiuqewU/edit?usp=drivesdk).

Common strategy is:

- Sort card by colour.
- For each colour identify so called ‚Äúbombs‚Äù ‚Äî cards that when played you feel would give you big advantage
- Decide which colours to go with. You will most probably end up with roughly same amount of cards in each colour, which means there's not enough to create single colour deck ‚Äî going with two colours is usually a good idea. Don't forget about your multi coloured cards.
- Use bombs and other cards in your selected colours to create the deck. It might turn out that you have good bombs in one colour, but really bad or few supporting cards. You might need to consider switching colours or create three-colour deck.

*Good luck and ‚Äî more importantly ‚Äî have fun.* üòÑ
