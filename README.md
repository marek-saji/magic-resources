  creatures? How many ones that cost X mana?)

### Card databases

- [Scryfall](https://scryfall.com)
  — good card database with advanced search

  this one over Scryfall.

Terms

- _booster_ — A pack of random cards. There are few different types of
  boosters, but let’s stick to Draft Boosters. They come with 15 cards:
  1 basic land, 10 common cards, 3 uncommons and one rare (or mythic
  rare). Other types of boosters are more expensive and have different
  distribution of rarity and sometimes some exclusive types of cards.

- _precon_ — Preconstructed decks sold by Wizards of the Coast.

- _jumpstart_ — Product from Wizards in form of 20–card boosters that
  include lands. The idea is that you can grab two at random, combine
  and have a working simple deck.

  <details><summary>There are different kinds of Jumpstarts</summary>

  Jumpstart originally came out in 2020 (called just “Jumpstart”).
  Since then Wizards released Jumpstart products for most of their sets,
  but they are worse than the original product. “Jumpstart 2023” is
  another Jumpstart product that’s not attached to any set and is also
  good.

  </details>

- _sealed_ — Even when people meet together and crack open six draft
  boosters and create decks (40+ cards) out of cards they got then play.
  Players can add any basic lands they need to create the decks.

- _draft_ — Similar to _sealed_, but instead of everybody having their
  own boosters, everybody opens a booster, chooses one card to keep and
  passes booster to their neighbour. You repeat that until run out of
  boosters and make a deck of cards you managed to get.
  <https://magic.wizards.com/en/formats/booster-draft>

- _commander_ — Format of play aimed for much longer games with more
  people. Decks have 100 cards (as opposed to regular 60 or 40) with
  just one copy of each cards (instead of regular up to 4 copies).
  One of the cards is denounced to be the “commander”:
  - All other cards have to share some of it’s mana identify colour
  - It lives outside of the library (in so called “command zone”) and
    can be summoned at any time. When it dies, it goes back there.
    Summoning it back costs +2 colourless mana more for each time it
    died.
