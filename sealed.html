    <h2>
      What will you need?
    </h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        6 unopened draft boosters
      </li>
      <li>
        Selection of basic lands
      </li>
      <li>
        Preferably: card sleeves
      </li>
      <li>
        Preferably: a box for the deck you will create (40+ cards)
      </li>
      <li>
        Box for the rest of the cards (~66)
        or all if you don’t have a deck box (~106)
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href=https://magic.wizards.com/en/products/companion-app>Magic Companion</a> app installed on your phone
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>
      How do we do it?
    </h2>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Everyone opens 6 boosters together.
      </li>
      <li>
        We let ourselves around ½ hour to create decks out of these
        cards. You can add as many basic lands as you need — the rest
        must come from the boosters.
      </li>
      <li>
        We use
        <a href=https://magic.wizards.com/en/products/companion-app>Magic Companion</a>
        to create the event and decide who plays with who.
      </li>
      <li>
        Winner of the event gets to keep “box topper” — a bonus card
        that’s included in a booster box (for most sets).
      </li>
      <li>
        We take any other cards (overflow boosters, cards that came free
        with the order etc.) and distribute them amongst players.
        Starting with last player they can keep one card and pass to the
        next player in the ranking. Last player choosing (event winner)
        chooses two cards and we continue in reverse order.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>
      Tips for building a deck
    </h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        We are required to build decks that have
        <strong>at least 40 cards</strong>. You are allowed to go over
        as much as you want, but it’s best to keep it up 40.
      </li>
      <li>
        There’s a <a href=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13lglvTH3dDVUz4k9G1NLzoiRJzrCaWacC0iLHiuqewU/edit?usp=drivesdk>recommended card distribution</a>.
      </li>
    </ul>

    Common strategy is:

    <ol>
      <li>
        Sort card by colour.
      </li>
      <li>
        For each colour identify so called “bombs” — cards that when
        played you feel would give you big advantage
      </li>
      <li>
        Decide which colours to go with. You will most probably end up
        with roughly same amount of cards in each colour, which means
        there’s not enough to create single colour deck — going with two
        colours is usually a good idea. Don’t forget about your multi
        coloured cards.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use bombs and other cards in your selected colours to create the
        deck. It might turn out that you have good bombs in one colour,
        but really bad or few supporting cards. You might need to
        consider switching colours or create three-colour deck.
      </li>
    </ol>
