            A pack of random cards. There are few different types of
            boosters, but let’s stick to Draft Boosters. They come with
            15 cards: 1 basic land, 10 common cards, 3 uncommons and one
            rare (or mythic rare). Other types of boosters are more
            expensive and have different distribution of rarity and
            sometimes some exclusive types of cards.

            Product from Wizards in form of 20–card boosters that
            include lands. The idea is that you can grab two at random,
            combine and have a working simple deck.

              There are different kinds of Jumpstarts
            </summary>

            <p>
              Jumpstart originally came out in 2020 (called just
              “Jumpstart”).  Since then Wizards released Jumpstart
              products for most of their sets, but they are worse than
              the original product. “Jumpstart 2023” is another
              Jumpstart product that’s not attached to any set and is
              also good.

            Even when people meet together and crack open six draft
            boosters and create decks (40+ cards) out of cards they got
            then play. Players can add any basic lands they need to
            create the decks.

            Similar to <a href=#term-sealed>sealed</a>, but instead of
            everybody having their own boosters, everybody opens a
            booster, chooses one card to keep and passes booster to
            their neighbour. You repeat that until run out of boosters
            and make a deck of cards you managed to get.

            Format of play aimed for much longer games with more people.
            Decks have 100 cards (as opposed to regular 60 or 40) with
            just one copy of each cards (instead of regular up to 4
            copies). One of the cards is denounced to be the
            “commander”:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              All other cards have to share some of it’s mana identify
              colour.

            <li>
              It lives outside of the library (in so called “command
              zone”) and can be summoned at any time. When it dies, it
              goes back there.  Summoning it back costs +2 colourless
              mana more for each time it died.
            </li>
          </ul>

            When you draw your starting hand and don’t like what you
            see, you can mulligan — i.e. shuffle your hand back into the
            deck, draw new seven cards, then choose one card and put it
            on the bottom of your library. You can repeat it multiple
            times, but each time you do, you need to put one additional
            card on the bottom of the library.
          </p>

          <p>
            In some situations you can mulligan for free — i.e. without
            having to bottom a card:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              when playing <a href=#term-commander>commander</a>, you
              get one mulligan for free,
            </li>
            <li>
              if both players are mulliganing and they agree to, they
              can do it for free,
            </li>
            <li>
              when you draw all lands or no lands (you can do it for
              free only once),
            </li>
            <li>
              as a house rule, if you draw just one land or just one
              non–land.
            </li>
