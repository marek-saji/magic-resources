              A pack of random cards. There are few different types of
              boosters, but let’s stick to Draft Boosters. They come with
              15 cards: 1 basic land, 10 common cards, 3 uncommons and one
              rare (or mythic rare). Other types of boosters are more
              expensive and have different distribution of rarity and
              sometimes some exclusive types of cards.

              Product from Wizards in form of 20–card boosters that
              include lands. The idea is that you can grab two at random,
              combine and have a working simple deck.

                There are different kinds of Jumpstarts
              </summary>

              <p>
                Jumpstart originally came out in 2020 (called just
                “Jumpstart”).  Since then Wizards released Jumpstart
                products for most of their sets, but they are worse than
                the original product. “Jumpstart 2023” is another
                Jumpstart product that’s not attached to any set and is
                also good.

              Even when people meet together and crack open six draft
              boosters and create decks (40+ cards) out of cards they got
              then play. Players can add any basic lands they need to
              create the decks.

              Similar to <a href=#term-sealed>sealed</a>, but instead of
              everybody having their own boosters, everybody opens a
              booster, chooses one card to keep and passes booster to
              their neighbour. You repeat that until run out of boosters
              and make a deck of cards you managed to get.

              Format of play aimed for much longer games with more people.
              Decks have 100 cards (as opposed to regular 60 or 40) with
              just one copy of each cards (instead of regular up to 4
              copies). One of the cards is denounced to be the
              “commander”:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                All other cards have to share some of it’s mana identify

                It lives outside of the library (in so called “command
                zone”) and can be summoned at any time. When it dies, it
                goes back there.  Summoning it back costs +2 colourless
                mana more for each time it died.
              </li>

            <p>
              When you draw your starting hand and don’t like what you
              see, you can mulligan — i.e. shuffle your hand back into the
              deck, draw new seven cards, then choose one card and put it
              on the bottom of your library. You can repeat it multiple
              times, but each time you do, you need to put one additional
              card on the bottom of the library.
            </p>

            <p>
              In some situations you can mulligan for free — i.e. without
              having to bottom a card:
            </p>

            <ul>

                when playing <a href=#term-commander>commander</a>, you
                get one mulligan for free,
              </li>
              <li>
                if both players are mulliganing and they agree to, they
                can do it for free,
              </li>
              <li>
                when you draw all lands or no lands (you can do it for
                free only once),
              </li>
              <li>
                as a house rule, if you draw just one land or just one
                non–land.
              </li>
