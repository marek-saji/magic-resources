            No <a href="term-mulligan">mulligans</a> are allowed. The

            Open three boosters for each player and <em>without looking
            at the cards</em> remove <a href=term-chuff>chuff</a>.
            Shuffle <em>all of the cards</em> together and put them in
            the middle of the table. Take four cards and put them face
            up creating four piles (for now one card per pile). Players
            take turns picking one pile to keep. After each player
            chooses, add one card to each of the piles. Continue until
            all cards are picked.
          </p>

          <p>
            Players will have to balance picking up piles with more
            cards vs piles with less (but better) cards.
          </p>

          <p>
            Then players spend some time building decks (40+ cards) out
            of what they got. They can add any basic lands they need.

            then passes the pack to the right. After they run out of

            Product from Wizards in form of 20–card packs that include
            lands. You can grab two of them, combine and have a working
            simple deck.
          </p>

          <p>
            When you have sealed packs, it’s fun to mix them without
            looking and play. After that you can pick and choose or grab
            them at random.
          </p>

          <p>
            Tip:
            Avoid combining two half–decks with the same colour to make
            separating them after the game easier.
          </p>

          <details>
            <summary>
              There are different kinds of Jumpstarts.
            </summary>

            <p>
              Jumpstart originally came out in 2020 (called just
              “Jumpstart”). Since then Wizards released Jumpstart
              products for most of their sets, but they are worse than
              the original product. “Jumpstart 2023” is another
              Jumpstart product that’s not attached to any set and is
              also good.

            <li>works best with two players</li>
            <li>traditional</li>
            <li>60 cards</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            The OG way to play. Decks have 60 cards, with up to 4 copies
            of each card (except for basic lands).
          </p>

          <p>
            There are multiple formats (Standard, Modern, Legacy,
            Vintage, …) that differ in which cards are allowed to use.
            For casual games you don’t have to worry about that, as long
            as you are sure that decks are on a similar power level.
          </p>

        <section id=commander aria-labelledby=commander-heading>

          <h4 id=commander-heading>Commander</h4>

          <ul>
            <li>works best for four players</li>
            <li>100 cards</li>
            <li>long games</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Format designed for longer games with more players, where
            politiking plays a bigger role. Decks have 100 cards, with no
            duplicates allowed (except for basic lands). One of the cards is
            the “commander” that lives outside of the deck (“command zone”)
            and can be summoned at any time. Usually remaining 99 cards
            synergise in some way with your commander. When commander leaves
            battlefield you can put it back in “command zone” and summon it
            again, but it costs two mana of any colour more each time.
            Players start with 40 life. When any commander deals total of 21
            damage to a player (“commander damage”), that player loses.
          </p>

          <p>
            In most cases it’se self–balancing. Even if decks are of
            different power levels, players naturaly attack the strongest
            player first.
          </p>

          <p>
            Probably the most popular format nowadays.

              A pack of random cards. There are few different types of
              boosters, but the ones that you should be focusing on are
              called “Draft Booster” or “Play Booster”. Other types of
              boosters are designed more for collecting than playing.

              When you draw your starting hand and don’t like what you
              see, you can mulligan — i.e. shuffle your hand back into the
              deck, draw new seven cards, then choose one card and put it
              on the bottom of your library. You can repeat it multiple
              times, but each time you do, you need to put one additional
              card on the bottom of the library.
            </p>

            <p>
              In some situations you can mulligan for free — i.e. without
              having to bottom a card:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                first mulligan, when playing multi–player game (e.g.
                <a href=#term-commander>commander</a>),
              </li>
              <li>
                if both players are mulliganing and they agree to,
              </li>
              <li>
                as a house rule, when you draw all lands or no lands,
              </li>
              <li>
                as a house rule, if you draw just one land or just one
                non–land.
              </li>
